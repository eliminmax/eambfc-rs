* -q and -j will not affect arguments passed before they were.

** Optimization can make error reporting less precise.

PARAMETER OPTIONS (provide at most once each):
{tape_size}
{extension}
{arch}
{out_suffix}

If not provided, it falls back to 8 as the tape-size count, ".bf" as the source extension, {default_arch} as the target arch, and an empty output suffix.

Remaining options are treated as source file names. If they don't end with the right extension, the program will raise an error.
Additionally, passing "--" as a standalone argument will stop argument parsing, and treat remaining arguments as source file names.
