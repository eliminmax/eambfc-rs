Usage: {} [options] <program.bf> [<program2.bf> ...]

 -h        - display this help text and exit
 -V        - print version information and exit
 -j        - print errors in JSON format
 -q        - don't print errors unless -j was passed
 -O        - enable optimization*.
 -k        - keep files that failed to compile (for debugging)
 -c        - continue to the next file instead of quitting if a
             file fails to compile
 -t count  - allocate <count> 4-KiB blocks for the tape
             (defaults to 8 if not specified)**
 -e ext    - use 'ext' as the extension for source files instead of '.bf'
             (This program will remove this at the end of the input
             file to create the output file name)**
 -a arch   - compile for specified architecture
             (defaults to {} if not specified)**
 -s ext    - use 'ext' as the extension for compiled binaries
             (they'll have no extension if -s is not passed)**
 -A        - list supported architectures and exit

* Optimization can make error reporting less precise.
** -a, -t, -e, and -s can only be passed at most once each.

Remaining options are treated as source file names. If they don't
end with '.bf' (or the extension specified with '-e'), the program
will raise an error.
