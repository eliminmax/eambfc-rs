A brainfuck source file with a bunch of useless constructs like ><+- and --+++-
it also contains loops that will never run [-like this one][ this one [ and this one ]]

Some of the dead and/or redundant code is not trivially obvious -
this one is split between 2 lines +

and[ this one is a dead loop but there is a - and a + between the previous loop and this one.]

an optimizing compiler would optimize away the entire file- making it identical to +["null.bf"]

also have enough consecutive + and - instructions to overflow instantly [that should also be optimized out, I guess.]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[ this is here so that the +- does not get optimized out immediately. ]
