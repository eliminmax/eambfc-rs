File contains Non ASCII characters and errors to check that that is compatible with code position reporting
(it should act as though text is in a superset of UTF8 that treats invalid bytes as standalone characters and report the number of codepoints as the column)

BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN EDITING THIS FILE TO AVOID OVERWRITING NON UNICODE BYTE
